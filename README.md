# taverna-varelia.gr
This project consists the official website of a traditional greek tavern, named Ta Varelia (The Barrels), located in Marousi, Athens.
It concerns a free-bootstrap template, first web-dev approach, during my studies in my MSc.
Aim is to promote my classmate's familial local business and offer an easy configured open-source template for future needs.
